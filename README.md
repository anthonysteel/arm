## Cooking Robot
Creating a robot that will function as an appliance to cook in the home
requires a cheap, high performance robotic arm and manipulator. Current open
source options have performance limitations or do not take advantage of some
of the constraints available to a robot in the kitchen. This repository provides
a robot that does.
