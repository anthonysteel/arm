The goal of this project is to:
	1. Provide a high quality generic 6DOF or greater robotic arm
	2. Provide a high quality generic dexterous manipulator
with the intent of creating a robot that can cook.

Existing arms that are common in robotics research:
	- Universal Robotics UR5e
	- KUKA iiwa
	- Kinova Gen2/3
	- FANUC CR-7 series
	- Franka Emika Panda
